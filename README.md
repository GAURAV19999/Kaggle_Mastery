# Kaggle Mastery
Being in the Data Science field its important that you keep practising your Problem Solving skills. Kaggle provides a platform to atleast practise the Feature Engineering & Moddelling aspect. Also, Kaggle provides a glimpse into Real World problems. To participate in Kaggle requires dedicated effort and focus to move up the progression and rank in any of the categories. Few months back I challenged myself to paticipate in Kaggle and move up ranks. In this Repository I plan to record all that I discover along the way. 

## Goals:

- Competitions (10)
- Datasets Upload (10)
- Notebooks (30)
- Discussions (2 Discussions x 365 Days = 730 Discussions)

## Kaggle Datasets Uploaded 

- [Data Science YouTube Channel Collection to Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/funxexcel/data-science-youtube-channel-collection-to-learn)
- [Retail Data Customer Summary (Learn Pandas Basics)](https://www.kaggle.com/funxexcel/retail-data-customer-summary-learn-pandas-basics)

## Kernels for Learning 

### Pandas Basics (Use Working Code if you want write codes yourself)
